# A Restful Drinkshop Backend Proof of Concept
## Quickstart
- Execute `npm i && npm start` on the command line to install the node packages and run the App.
- No Docker is required to run at this time - the db has been moved to the cloud - please contact the developer to get the .env file and access the service.
NOTE: the IP address 203.194.51.158/32 (Walker St N. Sydney) has been cleared with GCP to accept connections to the cloud sql. If another address is required please contact the developer.
## Description
This application demonstrates CRUD operations with relational databases using Node/Express and MySQL for Project Learn Good at Coder Academy.
